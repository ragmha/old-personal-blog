<center><h1>ðŸ’  Phases of life cycle</h1><center>

---
  <center> <h1>1</h1> </center>

>  `Analyze` the problem precisely and completely. Be sure to `specify` all necessary user interface with care.

---
  <center> <h1>2</h1> </center>

>   `Build` a prototype and `experiment` with it until all specifications can be finalized.

---
 <center> <h1>3</h1> </center>

>   `Design` the algorithm, using the tools of data structures and of other algorithms whose function is already known.

---
 <center> <h1>4</h1> </center>

>   `Verify` that the algorithmm is correct, or make it so simple that its correctness is self-evident.

---
 <center> <h1>5</h1> </center>

>    `Analyze` the algorithm to determine its requirements and make sure that it meets the specifications.

---
 <center> <h1>6</h1> </center>

>    `Code` the algorithm into the appropriate programming language.

---
 <center> <h1>7</h1> </center>

>    `Test` and `evaluate` the program on carefully chosen test data.

---
 <center> <h1>8</h1> </center>

>   `Refine` and `repeat` the foregoing steps are neeeded for additional subprograms until the software is complete and fully functional.

---
<center> <h1>9</h1> </center>

>   `Optimize` the code to improve performance, but only if necessary.

---
<center> <h1>10</h1> </center>

>   `Maintain` the program so that it will meet the changing needs of its users.
